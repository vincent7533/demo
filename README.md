Please run Castle from CastleDemo.java
I already have some test cases, please feel free to add more
The Assumption I made on it is:

1.the first and last elements of array are both peak/valley
for example {1,3,2} have two valley 1 and 2, and one peak 3.

Please run Transformer from TransformerDemo.java
I already have some test cases, please feel free to add more
The Assumption I made on it is:

1.Transformer can have any name as long as it only contains letter and space.'

2.Duplicated transformer names are allowed

3.Each team has to have at least one transformer to be a valid input.

4.The information of one transformer is in one String splited by comma.
    Space is not allowed anywhere other than transformer name.

5.For winning team, only team name will be displayed.
For example, instead of display "Winning team (Decepticons): Soundwave",
we will display "The winner team is Autobot"
